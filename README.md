## Instructions

1. You have already been given the HTML boilerplate. You just have to add css.
2. Each `grid-item` has a `background-color` of `lightgray`, `height` of `150px` and a `width` of `200px`. It should have a `border-radius` of `5px`. The `font-size` should be `40px`.
3. The content inside the grid-container must be centered using flex properties.
